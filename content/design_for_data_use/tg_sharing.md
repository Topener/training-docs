# Trainer’s Guide to Sharing

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session "Sharing and User Groups" This session follows the standard Academy training approach with 

1. a live demo session where the trainer demonstrate and explain the features, and 
   
2. a hands-­on session with exercises where participants get to practice the same features.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the live demo session. The “Live Demo step by step” section has a detailed walkthrough of all the steps to demonstrate with explanations and screenshots that should be easy to follow. Use that when preparing for the live demo session.

There is also a Quick Guide which lists the steps very briefly and this is meant as a lookup guide or “cheatsheet” WHILE doing the demo, to help the trainer remember all the steps and the flow of the demo.

## Learning objectives for this session

1. Review the sharing concept
2. Explain the link between sharing, user roles and user groups
3. Describe the difference between metadata and data sharing
4. Identify the aggregate metadata that can be shared

## Best Practices

Before starting the demonstration, please keep in mind that the most important thing is that the audience is following, so make sure to ask questions to the audience to verify that they are following. If something is unclear, go back and go through it slowly. If you don’t have time for all the steps, it is better to cut some steps, than to go fast while nobody understands.

In an online setting, you will be breaking regularly to allow them to perform various ungraded exercises in order to keep them engaged.

In an in-person setting, the participants may be doing the demo with you at the same time. In this scenario, it is ideal if there are other trainer's moving around the room to support participant's as it will be difficult for the trainer leading the session to answer many individual questions during the demonstrations. 

## Quick Guide

1. Review the user role aggregate data entry, explain each of the sections within the user-interface when creating or editing a user role
2. Review the specific authorities for the aggregate data capture role
3. Discuss the aggregate authorities in more detail
4. Log in to a user with the aggregate data capture role in the aggregate customization instance
Username : 
Password : District1#

STOP - Perform Exercise 1

5. Create a new user and assign it to the aggregate data capture user role. Test the user

STOP - Perform Exercise 2

6. Create a new user role - aggregate data analysis
7. Assign this user role to the user you have previously made and test the user

STOP - Perform Exercise 3


8. Review the recap slide
9. Have them perform the assignment
