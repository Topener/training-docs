# Trainer’s Guide to Data Element Groups and Group Sets

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session "Organisation Unit Groups and Group Sets." This session follows the standard Academy training approach with 

1. a live demo session where the trainer demonstrate and explain the features, and 
   
2. a hands-­on session with exercises where participants get to practice the same features.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the live demo session. The “Live Demo step by step” section has a detailed walkthrough of all the steps to demonstrate with explanations and screenshots that should be easy to follow. Use that when preparing for the live demo session.

There is also a Quick Guide which lists the steps very briefly and this is meant as a lookup guide or “cheatsheet” WHILE doing the demo, to help the trainer remember all the steps and the flow of the demo.

## Learning objectives for this session

1. Describe what organisation unit groups are
2. Describe what organisation unit group sets are
3. Use organisation unit groups in analysis apps
4. Use organisation unit group sets in analysis apps
5. Configure organisation unit groups in maintenance
6. Configure organisation unit group sets in maintenance

## Background

Program Indicators offer a flexible way of interacting with tracker data and allow for a number of advanced functionality as it relates to aggregating or summarizing individual tracker data. This session will focus on how program indicators can be used in data visualizer, maps and event reports to both display information related to a single tracked entity as well as summarize data for many tracked entities based on the org unit and period you are working with. 

## Preparations

This session will see you creating a number of visualizations. Ensure that you have run analytics in the demo database you are using and that all the data is being populated correctly. If you find that data is not present for the correct period or year, please contact the training content team so we can advise how to move the data correctly.

You should consider running through the entire demo prior to presenting it. After this, you should take the quick guide and supplement it with any additional notes you made while running through the demo. If you identify any changes that may be required or additional explanation that would be helpful within the session, please content the training content team in order to allow us to evaluate how to best integrate this feedback into the material.

Every visualization that you are asked to create has been saved and should be shared for public view. You can open each one up and review how it is has been made if you are unsure about any of the visualizations contents.

Also, the learner's guide and session summary are the main material that will be provided to the learner's with both detailed steps for ungraded exercises as well as the key messages from the session. Review these as well to ensure you are able to discuss these key points during your demonstration.

## Best Practices

Before starting the demonstration, please keep in mind that the most important thing is that the audience is following, so make sure to ask questions to the audience to verify that they are following. If something is unclear, go back and go through it slowly. If you don’t have time for all the steps, it is better to cut some steps, than to go fast while nobody understands.

In an online setting, you will be breaking regularly to allow them to perform various ungraded exercises in order to keep them engaged.

In an in-person setting, the participants may be doing the demo with you at the same time. In this scenario, it is ideal if there are other trainer's moving around the room to support participant's as it will be difficult for the trainer leading the session to answer many individual questions during the demonstrations.
