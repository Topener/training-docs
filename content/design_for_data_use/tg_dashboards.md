# Trainer’s Guide to Dashboards

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session "Dashboards" This session follows the standard Academy training approach with 

1. a live demo session where the trainer demonstrate and explain the features, and 
   
2. a hands-­on session with exercises where participants get to practice the same features.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the live demo session. The “Live Demo step by step” section has a detailed walkthrough of all the steps to demonstrate with explanations and screenshots that should be easy to follow. Use that when preparing for the live demo session.

There is also a Quick Guide which lists the steps very briefly and this is meant as a lookup guide or “cheatsheet” WHILE doing the demo, to help the trainer remember all the steps and the flow of the demo.
