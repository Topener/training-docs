# Introduction

This section discusses some of the considerations to make when performing capacity building activities. Capacity building solutions can be divided into 2 key areas

1. Learning Solutions : These types of solutions focus on providing materials, references, guidance or training
2. Performance Solutions : These types of solutions focus on organizational policies, procedures, work practices, etc.)

You can review of breakdown of these in Figure 1.

In most scenarios when working with DHIS 2, the immediate impulse is to consider learning solutions; however this may not always yield the best outcome on its own. We will provide an explanation of both of these types of solutions as well as considerations that need to be made when implementing them.

## Scenario

So we can apply each of our concepts in a practical context, we will outline a real-world scenario that we can use.

> You have implemented a tracker program for COVID-19 vaccination. As this is a completely new process, you know a learning solution will be required to build capacity within your teams to enter data and interact with this new workflow. In order to implement a successful learning solution, what would you do?

## Developing New Learning Solutions

When it is determined that a learning solution is needed; there are 5 steps we can follow.

* Understanding the **needs** of your audience
* **Designing** your learning solution
* **Developing** sessions and materials (or adapting existing materials)
* **Implementing** the actual solution (commonly in the form of a training)
* **Evaluating** your outcomes

### Needs Analysis

This first step prior to conducting your training is to understand the needs of your learner's. This does not need to be a comprehensive or time-consuming process if you have an already identified gap as a result of introducing a new process (for example, a new data collection form, a new set of indicators, a new dashboard) that you are rolling out in response to meeting specific requirements within your context. It is important however to also consider how to manage expectations in this step, as the scope can quickly become to large if you are not able to consider the immediate needs you are trying to address by creating a new learning solution. You can take this into consideration by following an outline like this when performing your needs analysis:

1. Identify the gap between current and desired results. 
    * In our scenario, we want to get to a point where our teams are proficient in entering data into our COVID-19 vaccination program. 
2. Prioritizing the gaps that have been identified
   * Here we would want to ensure that we are addressing our gaps in the right order. This may involve modifying the order items are presented within a single training event, or potentially considering additional training events in the future. An example of this could be training on tracker data analysis. While this is relevant when working with the COVID-19 vaccination program, it would not address our immediate needs to get the data into the system. Also, if there is a large current learning gap, addressing several priorities at once may be overwhelming for the teams you are trying to build capacity in.
3. Identifying the cause of the identified gaps
      * Have they ever used DHIS2 before?
      * Have they ever entered tracker data before?
      * Do they understand all of the different workflows that are within the COVID-19 vaccination program?
