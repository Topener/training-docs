# Introduction

This guide is an FAQ and describes some of the common concerns that have been received when conducting DHIS2 trainings/academies. Examples of these concerns include where material or demo databases can be found, what to do when a learner is not able to finish all of the training related exercises/assignments on time, etc.

# Target Audience

This guide targets anyone who is either considering or has conducted a DHIS2 related training. While many of the concepts discussed here use DHIS2 academy specific examples, these concepts can be generalized and applied to other DHIS2 training, including local training. This guidance is based on feedback that has been received throughout conducting academies and trainings over the course of several years and should hopefully support you in providing practical steps for conducting your training.

# Working with a Training Database

Databases are a critical practical consideration when conducting a DHIS2 academy or training. They are the basis in which all materials will be derived from, and if supporting components are not available to meet outlined learning objectives then training outcomes will not be as intended. When performing a local training, it is always recommended to use a copy of the local database. When conducting a global or regional training, several databases are maintained for use in conjunction with the course material in order to meet pre-defined learning objectives.
