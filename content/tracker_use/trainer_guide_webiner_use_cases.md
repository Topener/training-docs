# Trainer's Guide to Tracker Use Cases (Webinar)

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the webinar “Tracker Use Cases.”

This session follows the approach of delivering shorter academy sessions that can be accessed by larger audiences (ie. those attending the academy as well as a general audience interested in tracker). A number of guidelines have been adopted from those available for the DHIS 2 Annual Conference.

### Time Requirements

This session should be held over no more then 2 hours.

Presentations should be no more than 15 minutes in length (and can be shorter if the presenter identifies as such). You should prepare for 10 mins of questions and answers regarding each use case within the session.

You do not need to fill all 2 hours. If you find you are only able to schedule 3-4 use cases as an example, you may end the webinar after the allotted time accordingly.

Make sure you communicate this with the individuals giving presentations during the use-case session so they are prepared to stick to the maximum time allotted.

## Background

Use cases are a key area to show how implementations are innovating in the field. Use cases in particular are accessible to wider audiences as they focus on the outputs of detailed technical and implementation work performed by a number of staff rather then focusing on the detailed technical steps to perform a specific task.

## Preparations

This session is a regional-focused session and will require you to gather use-cases specific to the region you are working in. While you should include use cases from the HISP groups within your region, consideration should also be made to reach out to local partners you are working with or whom might attend the academy to give them an opportunity to present their work within the region.

## Presentations

A downloadable template for presentations is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nCATmO5HdQWdv3J5wWKvV4X-JS__lgCL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103928845569877128332&rtpof=true&sd=true) if required. Please note the local partners can use a template of their choosing to reflect organizational branding.

A guideline for the presentations that should be ***shared with all presenters*** is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QACzvSvq9Giv8Uwod67Sc6kjsFzzpEPvF7CAe-M8vS8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Using Zoom

Two guidelines are available for zoom.

- The first guideline is detailed and discusses general planning as well as all of the various features that can used within zoom during the webinar. It is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kSWcSyqK6cYUR_SPNqrEk5xzRnAR_FRH3-SBkjleqXo/edit?usp=sharing). This is ***mainly meant for the hosts*** of the zoom webinar so they can control various aspects of the webinar while it is running.
- The second guideline is shorter in length and is meant for anyone presenting within zoom. This is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EvRcSV3uYDtplDYHU57V6MDdMU7weehmnnBOjie5ty4/edit?usp=sharing). This can be s***hared with any of the presenters*** involved in the webinar.
