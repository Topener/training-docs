# Tracker Use Academy SOP - Running the Academy and Locating all of the Resources

## Session Content

Sessions are generally made up of 6 pieces of content

1. Presentation
2. Trainer's Guide
3. Learner's Guide
4. Recap
5. Graded Assignment
6. Session Summary

### Presentation

Each session starts off with a presentation, even the sessions that rely more heavily on demos. At minimum, a presentation will contain the learning objectives for the session. The tracker data model is the only fully conceptual session that relies mostly on the use of a presentation. 

### Trainer's Guide

The trainer's guide contains step-by-step instructions for performing the demonstrations within the academy. The steps to be performed must be done in the corresponding database, or they will need to be modified substantially.

### Learner's Guide

The learner's guide is the learner's companion to the trainer's guide. It contains the step-by-step instructions for the learner to follow along with what the trainer is demonstrating. Session's are broken up to allow the learner to attempt to replicate what the trainer has presented within the trainer's guide. 

### Recap

Each session has a 1-slide recap of what was covered in the session. This is there to wrap up the session and provide a quick review of what was covered.

### Graded Assignment

Several of the sessions have graded assignments. Due to time constraint's, it is generally recommended that the graded assignments are performed outside of the live class setting prior to the next session.

### Session Summary

This resource is for learner's and provides a brief review of the key concepts presented during a session. It is a companion to the learner's guide; with the learner's guide provided details and step-by-step instructions, while the session summary provides a very brief review of concepts presented during the session. The session summary is meant to provide learner's with a tool that can more easily be referred to when the academy is complete.
